As a User I want to be able to
	Login in a safe and comfortable manner to Mdo
	After succesful login I should know that Im logged in

Safe:
- Login request is sent with POST method
- User is never told which input is wrong, her id (email or username) or password 
Comfortable:
- User is able to log in with her username or email

Succes:
- Layout slightly change, login form and register button disappears, user profile link in nav menu apears, short message is displayed
Fail:
- When incorrect input was sent, message is displayed
- If server error occured mesage is displayed
