As a User I want to be able to 
	Register to Mdo, for future personalization of service
	Registration should be simple, fast, secure

Simple:
- User will have to give only username, his email and password to be able to register
Fast:
- Limited number of fields makes registration fast, also client side validation prevents from unnecessary calls to server
Secure:
- User need to input password twice to make sure she did typed it correctly
- Password is then sent with POST request to server
- Server is salting and hashing password

Successfull:
- User created her account and is redirected to homepage logged in with username she registered

Failed:
- Error is made during input phase, and user immediatelly sees popup with error
- Email or Username that User stated, already exists, then appropriate message is displayed, after call to server
- If unable to connect to server message is displayed
- If occured during processing of request message is displayed
