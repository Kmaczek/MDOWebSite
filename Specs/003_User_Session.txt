As a User
Given that I loged in to application, and then closed browser(without loging out)
While opening page again i want my session to be restored, and refreshed

Comfortable:
- User dont have to log in each time she open page

Succes:
- User is logged in, layout from login is applied
Fail:
- User is not logged in, no layout changes
